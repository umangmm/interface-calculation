# interface-calculation
language :- Core java
Data Structure :- Stacks
Algorithm :- Making four stacks among them two are temporary and other two are used  for getting the output.
             Using concept of interface to implememnt all the operations.
             First step to put all the values in value stack and all the opaerator in operator stacks.
             Start iterating opaerator stack and solve all the operation according to priority wise
             priority is as follow { / , * , + , - }
             To solve the problem of repetition of operator we use two temporary stacks.
